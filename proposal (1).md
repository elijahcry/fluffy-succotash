# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Price Comparing Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This project will compare prices across multiple websites, create an average, and give you the website with the lowest price. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
Apart from comparing prices across multiple websites and giving the website with the lowest price, we will take into account product reviews. We will use data from forums and create a review analysis of the product. It will be executed through a python bot from a user input. The python bot will read the website's html code to get the info. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I will not be combining this project with another course.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will at least be able to scrape a website for certain information>

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be to be able to scrape websites and gain information regarding price and reviews of products.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best outcome would be to scrape all the information regarding prices and reviews of products from these websites and use them as values in our code, and to calculate the best products using both values.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

How to read html with python, how to scan and parse information throught python. We will figure out how to divide the work as we research.
